    "# Apache Mesos HTTP API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show how to connect to a running Apache Mesos Master and launch an Ngnix container to serve pages from a static website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this notebook is to show how to interact with the new [Mesos HTTP API](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/docs/scheduler-http-api.md) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this blog entry](https://codetrips.com/2016/08/27/a-python-notebook-to-experiment-with-the-apache-mesos-http-api-part-1-of-3/) for more information about setting up your development environment to run Mesos and this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Mesos\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vagrant Up\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a [`Vagrantfile`](https://github.com/massenz/zk-mesos/blob/develop/vagrant/Vagrantfile) provided in this repository (along with a couple of `provisioning` shell scripts) that will do the needful:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd vagrant\n",
    "    vagrant up\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create two VMs (Master and Agent) running under [Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org) and reachable at, respectively, `192.168.33.10:5050` and `192.168.33.11:5051`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also edit the host machine's `/etc/hosts/` file to make those IPs be the targets for hostnames `mesos-master` and `mesos-agent`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add at the end of your /etc/hosts:\n",
    "    mesos-master   192.168.33.10\n",
    "    mesos-agent    192.168.33.11\n",
    "    \n",
    "Test that Mesos is running __before__ executing this notebook by opening a browser and pointing it to http://192.168.33.10:5050: it should show the status page of the Mesos Master.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshooting Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "If either the Master/Agent do not come up (or they do and fail) troubleshooting the actual cause of failure is going to be hard; this is what I typically do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* re-provision the VMs (`vagrant halt` and `vagrant up --provision`);\n",
    "* destroy the VMs (`vagrant destroy`) and run `vagrant up` again;\n",
    "* log on either VM (`vagrant ssh master`) and look at the logs (in `/var/local/mesos/logs/master`), fix whatever needs fixing and try to re-run Mesos from within the VM:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd\n",
    "sudo ./run-master.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "I always strongly recommend that folks use virtual environments when messing around with Python and installing libraries - feel free to skip this, but if you end up borking your system... **you have been warned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to some issues around JSON and string encoding, this notebook only runs with Python 2.7, so make sure this is what the virtual env is going to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo pip install virtualenv\n",
    "virtualenv -p `which python2` demo\n",
    "source demo/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then load this file (`notebooks/demo.pynb`) in the browser page that opens (if it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:8888).\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy hacking!"
