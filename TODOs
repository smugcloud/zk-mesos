1. Add another VM to run ZK node via vagrant - DONE

2. Change script so that Content Server runs from Master
   (simplifies setup and avoids manual step) - WON'T FIX

3. Vagrant agent gets created with only 512MB RAM - find out why
   (the configuration argument is there, it seems it's ignored). - DONE

4. Convert Vagrantfile to use v2 syntax - DONE
